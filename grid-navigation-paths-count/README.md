Grid navigation paths
==========

Suppose you're on a NxM grid. Write a program that prints how many different paths can you take to go from the bottom left to the top right. You can only move right or up.

Consider the cells as the path.

Run
==========
To find the number of possible paths, run the following command:

```
python paths_count.py
```

Considering that you start in the bottom left corner, you can list all the possible directions that you can follow in order to arrive at the top right by running the command:
```
python paths_list.py
```

For both scripts, the grid size must be higher than 1x1.
